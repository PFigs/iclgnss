<h4>Note for possible registration problems!</h4>

<p>
If you were redirected to this page due to an error in registration, it is most probably due to your firewall or proxy settings. The registration script can be only called from the valid TUT pages, i.e., you might encounter problems if the calling page is in your proxy cache. Try from your colleague's computer, from outside the firewall, or try to configure the traffic to TUT.FI domain to pass by the proxy.

Sorry for any inconvenience that these internet traffic security checks may cause.
