                                    <p>
                                        GNSS authentication, or the lack thereof, has been a subject of intense discussion over more than a decade in the satellite navigation community. However, no GNSS currently provides any authentication features to its open service users. Galileo, the European satellite navigation system, has been studying the addition of authentication for its services. This new feature is in the pipeline for its operational provision by the end of the decade.  This talk will present the authentication message and signal defined in the Galileo E1 (Open Service) and E6 (Commercial Service), the service provision roadmap, and the performance and security levels obtained in the lab and field testing.</br>
                                        The translation of GNSS authentication features to secured services in consumer and professional receivers may lead to some innovations and standards in the future. Some open points and challenges in this area will also be presented. They relate to key management, combination of authenticated and non-authenticated signals and sensors, authentication in an A-GNSS context where most receivers will operate, and integration of an authentication status in the existing location services

                                        Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising approach to efficiently utilize the scarce RF spectrum resource. In this paradigm, knowledge about spectrum occupancy in time, frequency, and space that is both accurate and timely is crucial in allowing CR networks to opportunistically use the spectrum, and avoid interference to a primary user (PU). In particular, information about PU location will enable several key capabilities in CR networks including improved spatio-temporal spectrum sensing, intelligent location-aware power control and routing, as well as aiding security and spectrum policy enforcement.
                                    </br>
                                        The PU localization problem in CR networks is in general different from localization in other applications such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Global Positioning System (GPS), due to the following two features.  First, a PU does not cooperate or communicate with CRs since they are opportunistic users of the PU spectrum band. Therefore, very limited knowledge about PU signaling, such as transmit power, modulation scheme and synchronization, is available to CRs. Second, since CRs need to detect and localize PUs in the entire coverage area at a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), cooperation among a large number of CRs is necessary, which introduces important accuracy and complexity constraints.
                                    </br>
                                        In this talk, we will explore a set of CR cooperative localization algorithms for single and multiple PUs using different antenna configurations and available measurements, and analyze their cost performance trade-offs both theoretically and experimentally.​

                                        Location-awareness is the capability of a mobile network to employ position information for the sake of operating more efficiently. It is foreseen that fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks will be able to exploit much more accurate position information than any previous generation of wireless networks. This comes naturally due to the increased bandwidth and the application of multi-antenna techniques, which will eventually turn multipath propagation from an enemy to a friend.
                                        </br>
                                        This talk will first highlight the impact of multipath propagation on the accuracy of wireless range and position estimation. The important influence of bandwidth and the benefit of MIMO processing will be analyzed. Next it will be shown how one can make use of multipath to benefit from improved positioning accuracy, robustness, and a relaxed need for infrastructure nodes. Analytical performance bounds, their experimental validation, and algorithms derived thereof will be discussed. Finally, it will be shown that a multipath-enabled positioning system is a showcase example of a cognitive dynamic system that can optimize the information gained from each measurement, exploiting its memory of past measurements to plan future measurements. The environment map it collects can be used to predict the propagation characteristics, yielding location-awareness for positioning and communications. It is concluded that the use of position information may become as important to 5G networks as other new, disruptive technologies such as massive MIMO and mm-wave.

                                    <b>Abstract</b>
                                    <p>
                                        GNSS chipsets found in mobile phones are a technological wonder. Not only do they occupy a few mm2, draw a handful of milliamps from the battery and possible share the die with another systems such as WiFi, Bluetooth or NFC, but also they implement very advanced techniques (digital filters configurable on-the-fly, hundreds of channels to maximize sensitivity, multipath-mitigation methods, tight integration with MEMS sensors, etc.) in order to be able to operate with meter-level accuracy in very adverse conditions caused by interferences from other components of the phone, poor visibility of the satellites, use of very simple antennas, rich multipath propagation, etc. The performance of these GNSS chipsets in benign environments is a heart-warming surprise, and it will be presented in the talk.
                                        </br>
                                        The talk will also give evidence that, thanks to the outstanding piece of engineering that GNSS chipsets are, RTK positioning at decimetre level is currently feasible in consumer devices. Protocols (the 3GPP LPP) and operating systems (the Android GNSS Hardware Abstraction Layer) that support the transmission of carrier phase measurements already exist. Experimental results using phones equipped with Broadcom chipsets will show that the chipsets performance is also at the required level to be suitable for RTK. The effects of the antenna, the baseline length, the use of another type of receiver as reference, etc. will be discussed in detail, as well as the need to tune cycle slip detectors given the abundance of these phase jumps produced by fading and the rough environment.
